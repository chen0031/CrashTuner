# HBASE-22023

## Scenario


1. Shutdown command comes   while RS is initializing, RS is marked as stopped

2. The leases  is not initialized due to

3. ```java
   if (!isStopped() && !isAborted()) {
     initializeThreads();
   }
   ```

4. But in normal start process, it still uses leases   without sanity check.

## Trigger analysis

1. As below code, metricsRegionServer is the meta-info variable.

```java
this.metricsRegionServer = new MetricsRegionServer()
if (getConfiguration().getBoolean("hbase.regionserver.workers", true)) {
     startServices();
 }
```

2. And it is written, we should crash the RS node, but due to metricsRegionServer  is already on RS node, so crash should change to shutdown.
