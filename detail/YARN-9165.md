1. YARN start to allocate a container on a node
2. YARN will get a node by NodeId
3. If one node just crashes, no node obtained, but yarn still use it, hence NPE happens

## Trigger analysis

```
 public N getNode(NodeId nodeId) {
   readLock.lock();
   try {
     return nodes.get(nodeId);
   } finally {
     readLock.unlock();
   }
 }
```

1. Above function code is the place where we read the nodes
2. This function has about 43 different contexts.
3. About 25 contexts have sanity check, so **context sensitive** is so import to trigger this bug.
4. Above code also has lock, moving the crash point to caller can also help us **avoid lock**.
