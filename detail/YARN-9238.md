1. Old AM is doing allocate on RM.
2. YARN will get the currentAttempt of old AM.
3. If one AM  just crashes, recovery process will fork a new attempt for retry.
4. currentAttempt will be set as new attempt.
5. But allocate still think it is allocating for old AM.
6. So exception will be thrown.

## Trigger analysis

```java
//code1
public void setCurrentAppAttempt(T currentAttempt) {
    this.currentAttempt = currentAttempt;
}
```

1. Above function code is the place where we set  the currentAttempt.

2. This function has about 3 different contexts, but only one is executed under one workload.

3. It also shows that if  a meta-info variable can be set in the method who is not constructor, the variable can be affteted by crash event(recovery process).

   

4. <div  align="center">

   </div>

5. ```java
   //code2:sanity check
   finishApplicationMaster(){
       AllocateResponseLock lock = responseMap.get(applicationAttemptId);
       if (lock == null) {
         throwApplicationDoesNotExistInCacheException(applicationAttemptId);
       }
   }
   ```

6. Code2 is the sanity check in the recovery process, if the crash event comes too early, then code2#5 will throw exception and will prevent the buggy code in Figure1 running.
7. So as Figure2 shows, Crash Timing is very important to trigger this bug.
