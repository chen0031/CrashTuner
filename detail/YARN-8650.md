1. NM is launching  the container

 ```java
  protected int prepareForLaunch(ContainerStartContext ctx) throws IOException {
    ContainerId containerId = container.getContainerId();//crash point
    dispatcher.getEventHandler().handle(new ContainerEvent(
        containerId,
        ContainerEventType.CONTAINER_LAUNCHED));
  }
 ```

2. Shutdown  command is sent to NM who holds the container. 
3. Recovery process will send KILL event to Container,  and the state change to DONE
4. Then Launcher will send LAUNCH_FAILED event to RMContainer( in code\#6)

## Trigger analysis

2. The sleep after shutdown is very important to flip the KILL event and LAUNCHED event.
