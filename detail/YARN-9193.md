# YARN-9193

## Scenario

1. YARN  chooses a container as master container.
2. YARN gets a container by ContainerId.
3. If one node just crashes, recovery process will clean all containers on it.
4. So no  container obtained, but YARN still use it, hence NPE happens.

## Trigger analysis

```
public RMContainer getRMContainer(ContainerId id) {
    return liveContainers.get(id);
}
```

1. Above function code is the place where we read the containers.
2. This function has about 29 different contexts.
3. About 28 contexts have sanity check, so **context sensitive** is so import to trigger this bug.
